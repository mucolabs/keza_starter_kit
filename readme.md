## What's in the Starter Kit

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Note that this is an opinionated starter kit with features tailored to my current needs, and it will continue to evolve as the project progresses. Pull requests are welcome for new features and improvements, especially since this project was built while I was learning and exploring the PHP and Laravel ecosystems.
